# Time Series Stock Price Prediction with LSTM: AWS Deployment


This project focused on predicting stock market prices using time series analysis. I explored methods like SMA, EMA, and LSTM, assessing their performance with real stock data. my program employs the LSTM model to predict next-day stock prices based on historical trends. The model's effectiveness was measured using RMSE, and I successfully deployed it on AWS for practical use. This project deepened our understanding of time series forecasting and its real-world implications.
